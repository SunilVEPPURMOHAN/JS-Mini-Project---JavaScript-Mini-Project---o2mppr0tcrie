# Simple authentication using HTML, CSS, JS

WHY?

1. Authenticating existing users with their username-password combo is a common requirement in most applications. This project will help us to sign up a non-existing user and also authenticate an existing user from localstorage database at a very basic level.

HOW?

1. We use javascript to manipulate inputs in a HTML form.
2. We use onclick/submit events to trigger functions that create and authenticate user with appropriate alerts

WHAT?
1.We use HTML form for inputs
2. We use onclick and onsubmit events to trigger signin / signup functions
3. We use localstorage to store sign in data
